1). Convert the following into code that uses a WHILE & FOR loop.

print 2
prints 4
prints 6
prints 8
prints 10
prints Goodbye!

Solution: 

num = 2     #####While loop
while num < 11:    #Or we can use <=10 as well
   print(num)
   num += 2
print("Goodbye!")


for i in range(2,11,2):
    print(i)
  
print("Goodbye!")


2). Convert the following into code that uses a while loop.

prints Hello!
prints 10
prints 8
prints 6
prints 4
prints 2

Solution:

num = 10
print("Hello!")
while num > 1:
   print(num)
   num -= 2 
   
print("Hello!")
for num in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(num)


3). 3. Write a while loop that sums the values 1 through end, inclusive. end is a variable that we define for you. So, for example, if
we define end to be 6, your code should print out the result:21. which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.

Solution:

num = 0
pepe = 0
while num <= end:
    pepe = pepe + num
    num = num + 1
print(pepe)


pepe=0
for i in range(end+1):
    pepe += i
print(pepe)
